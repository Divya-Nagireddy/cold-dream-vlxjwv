# Tasks

While coding / reviewing, please explain your thought process and things that you notive. This is 50% to see how we communicate and reason about problems and tasks.

*In order of importance, here is where to focus:*

## Handling async data
Fix the way data is being consumed, bonus points for a custom hook that returns a loading state + data.

## Component composition + code organization
We're looking for common React patterns (containers, dumb components).

## Pass in callbacks
We want to process analytics from the api.js helper, but need to bind some data from the parent component.

## Responsive design
We should see 3 product cards side by side on desktop, and have them stacked on mobile. Use as much styling as you see fit to get it "presentable"

## Code review
There are some inconsitencies, feel free to rename classes and add missing React basics where you see fit.
